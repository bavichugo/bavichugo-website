          My name is Victor Hugo Batistela, and this is my portfolio! I was born
          in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and moved to the United States in 2017. I
          currently study Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of
          Technology and am looking for opportunities in the Software Engineering
          world. I am passionate about traveling, experiencing new adventures,
          and I am always down to play some Volleyball!
